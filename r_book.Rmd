This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# install.packages("RPostgreSQL")
require("RPostgreSQL")

# create a connection
# save the password that we can "hide" it as best as we can by collapsing it
pw <- {
  "Rh8E1s#p#5"
}

# loads the PostgreSQL driver
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
# creates a connection to the postgres database
# note that "con" will be used later in each connection to the database
#Enter the values for you database connection
dsn_database = "talend"            # e.g. "compose"
dsn_hostname = "bi-proxy" # e.g.: "aws-us-east-1-portal.4.dblayer.com"
dsn_port = "6433"                 # e.g. 11101 
dsn_uid = "mmueller"        # e.g. "admin"
dsn_pwd = pw      # e.g. "xxx"

tryCatch({
  drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
  print("Connecting to database")
  conn <- dbConnect(drv, 
                    dbname = dsn_database,
                    host = dsn_hostname, 
                    port = dsn_port,
                    user = dsn_uid, 
                    password = dsn_pwd)
  print("Connected!")
},
error=function(cond) {
  print("Unable to connect to database.")
})


# check for the cartable
df <- dbGetQuery(conn, "select distinct status from ext_sales.salesforce_lead")
df
